## Projectoverview -Symptom Medicare
This health-simulated demo project aims to tackle critical health challenges in Nigeria by providing a smarter way to diagnose diseases based on physical symptoms. It seeks to reduce misdiagnosis and the inappropriate use of antimalarial and antibiotic drugs by the public. By guiding healthcare workers toward more accurate assessments, it will ultimately lead to the earlier detection and diagnosis of diseases, ensuring patients receive the right treatment at the right time.
