# Symptom_MediCare
## Projectoverview -Symptom Medicare
This health-simulated demo project aims to tackle critical health challenges in Nigeria by providing a smarter way to diagnose diseases based on physical symptoms. It seeks to reduce misdiagnosis and the inappropriate use of antimalarial and antibiotic drugs by the public. By guiding healthcare workers toward more accurate assessments, it will ultimately lead to the earlier detection and diagnosis of diseases, ensuring patients receive the right treatment at the right time.

## Problems that project aim to address:

#### Symptom MediCare is designed to:
1. Reduce Misdiagnosis: By guiding healthcare workers toward more accurate assessments.
2. Prevent Drug Misuse: Ensuring people use the right medicine for the right illness, reducing inappropriate use of important drugs.
3. Enable Early Detection: Leading to earlier diagnosis, so patients receive the right treatment at the right time.

## Project Features:
1. For our demo, we built a foundational system using Pandas for data handling and probabilistic approaches called Naive Bayes.
2. A key feature you'll see in our demo is that after symptoms are entered, we plot a chart to visually show the probability distribution of the likely diseases. This would helps healthcare workers see not just one possible diagnosis, but the relative chances of different illnesses, aiding their decision-making.
##### For this demo, we're focusing on Nigeria's most common diseases: Malaria, Typhoid, and HIV/AIDS with ten(10) physical symptoms

## APP Deployment
This health simulated demo app will be depolyed on Streamlit


## Future plan and Innovation:
We look forward to using advanced Machine Learning to build an even more robust AI model. We also aim to introduce databases where vital user information like age, gender, and location can be securely stored. This data will be valuable for medical research and crucial for tracking disease outbreaks across Nigeria and the World at large
